    <h1>Our Motivation</h1>
    <p>•	During the global COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020, college engineering classes
        shifted suddenly in teaching modality from in-person, to online instruction
        <br/> •	Was engineering-related self-efficacy and outcome expectations impacted during this
        period? </p>

    <h1>A little background</h1>
    <p> <strong>1. Social Cognitive Career Theory</strong> 
        <br/>Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, and Hackett, 1994; 2000), 
        describes how the social cognitions of self-efficacy and outcome
        expectations are related to the development of career-related interests, choice goals,
        actions and performance</p>

        <br/><em><strong>Relationship between self-efficacy and outcomes</strong></em>

        <p> <strong>2. Self-Efficacy</strong>
        <br/>- An individual’s belief in their ability to plan and complete a specific task (Bandura 1977)
        <br/>- Hypothesized to relate to avoiding or approaching certain career options, the quality of
        performance, and their persistence when faced with obstacles</p>

                    <br/>- Social cognitions may also support engineering persistence (staying in the engineering major or continuing the engineering degree through perceived challenges)

    <h1>Our Question</h1>
    <h2><em>How would students’ social cognitions be impacted by the sudden shifts in teaching instruction during Spring 2020?</em></h2></div>

    <h1>What We Did</h1>
    <p>-	Administered surveys at 3 time points during the during the 16-week academic spring
        semester of 2020
        <br/>-	Sample: Over 200 students in 8 engineering courses</p>
    </div>
    <hr class="dashed">

    <div id="G">
    <h1>What we found</h1>
    <p>- Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in engineering self-efficacy
        scores on the two utilized measures between Time 1 and Time 3 but not between the
        other time points in the overall results. Although the increase was statistically significant
        (p &lt; 0.01; p &lt; 0.5) the magnitude of the increase was marginal (only 7%-8% increase in
        the mean score).

    <h1>Last Thoughts/Next Steps</h1>
    <p>-	Despite the abrupt transition online to remote education, students increased in their
        confidence in their ability to succeed in their engineering coursework (self-efficacy), and
        for the most part still intend to major and find employment in engineering (persistence).
        <br/>-	 Will form Faculty Learning Community to improve teaching practices. Future study will
        look at if changes in teaching practices and impact the social cognitions.</p>

    <h3>Engineering Faculty Learning Community</h3>
    <p>This learning community is part of a NSF funded study to evaluate the effect of changes in teaching practices on student social cognitions.
        <br/> Project Goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To increase the participation of women in engineering through enhanced social cognitions which have been linked to career outcomes.</li>
        <li>To create a learning community comprised of engineering faculty to learn about social cognitive based teaching practices.</li>
        <li>To support faculty in designing and implementing these teaching practices.</li>
        <li>To assess the effectiveness of social cognitive based teaching practices on engineering students’ self-efficacy and outcome expectations.</li>
    </ul>
