    <h3>What The Idea Started From</h3>
    <p>•	During the global COVID-19 pandemic in Spring 2020, college engineering classes shifted suddenly in teaching modality from in-person, to online instruction
        <br/> •	Engineering-related self-efficacy and outcome expectations may have been impacted during this period </p>
   
    <h3>What We Measured</h3>
    <p> <strong>Social Cognitive Career Theory</strong> 
        <br/>Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT; Lent, Brown, and Hackett, 1994; 2000), 
        demonstrated above describes how the social cognitions of self-efficacy and outcome expectations are related to 
        the development of career-related interests, choice goals, actions and performance
        <br/><br/>Overview of SCCT model (based on Lent et al. 1994)

        <p> <strong>Self-Efficacy</strong>
        <br/>- An individual’s belief in their ability to plan and complete a specific task (Bandura 1977)
        <br/>- Hypothesized to relate to avoiding or approaching certain career options, the quality of performance, and their persistence when faced with obstacles
       <br/><br/>Sources of Self-efficacy (https://www.simplypsychology.org/self-efficacy.html)
        <br/><img src="Picture2.png" alt="Sources of Self-efficacy" width="600" height="400"></p>
        
        <p> <strong>Outcome Expectations</strong>
        <br/>Expected outcomes and anticipated consequences for engaging in a particular behavior </p>
    <p> <strong>The Connection</strong>
    <br/>- Social cognitions of self-efficacy and outcome expectations are significant predictors of choice goals and actions in STEM fields 
    <br/>- Social cognitions may also support engineering persistence (staying in the engineering major or continuing the engineering degree through perceived challenges)

    <h3>What We Question</h3>
    <p><strong>- How would students social cognitions be impacted by the sudden shifts in teaching instruction during Spring 2020? </strong></p>

    <h3>What We Did</h3>
    <p>-	Administered surveys at 3 time points during the during the 16-week academic spring semester of 2020
        <br/>-	Sample: Over 200 students in 8 engineering courses</p>
    
    <h3>What we found</h3>
    <p>-	Engineering Self-Efficacy: Increased between time 1 and time 3 for 3 courses 
        <br/>-	Engineering Persistence Intentions: decreased between time 1 and time 3 in one course and stayed same in all others
        <br/>-	Outcome expectations and motivation remained the same generally across
        <br/><br/>Figure: Trend of Mean Scores for Each Measure

    <h3>Last Thoughts/Next Steps</h3>
    <p>-	Students seem to have increased in their engineering confidence during the semester despite pandemic-related changes
        <br/>-	 In future may explore how engineering related major studies may have been affected by the increased presence of science and
         health career fields in mainstream media</p>

    <h3>Engineering Faculty Learning Community</h3>
    <p>This learning community is part of a NSF funded study to evaluate the effect of changes in teaching practices on student social cognitions.
        <br/> Project Goals:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To increase the participation of women in engineering through enhanced social cognitions which have been linked to career outcomes.</li>
        <li>To create a learning community comprised of engineering faculty to learn about social cognitive based teaching practices.</li>
        <li>To support faculty in designing and implementing these teaching practices.</li>
        <li>To assess the effectiveness of social cognitive based teaching practices on engineering students’ self-efficacy and outcome expectations.</li>
    </ul>
